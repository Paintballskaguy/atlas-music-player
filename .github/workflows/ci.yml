name: CI - Run Tests & Coverage

# 1. Define when this workflow should run
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ] # Only runs when commits are pushed to the 'main' branch

# 2. Define the jobs (tasks) to be executed
jobs:
  test_and_coverage:
    # Use the latest stable version of Ubuntu
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # 3. Define the steps within the job
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checkout the code
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Set up Node.js
      # Assumes your project uses Node.js (common for Vitest/JavaScript projects)
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20' # Use a recent LTS version

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        # This assumes your dependencies are listed in package.json
        run: npm ci

      # Step 4: Run unit tests and generate coverage report
      - name: Run Vitest tests with coverage
        run: npx vitest run --coverage
        # Equivalent to: npm run coverage (if you set up the script in package.json)

      # Optional Step 5: Upload the coverage report artifact
      # This is useful if you want to inspect the full HTML report later.
      - name: Upload coverage report artifact
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: vitest-coverage-report
          path: coverage/
          if-no-files-found: warn # Don't fail if the folder wasn't created
